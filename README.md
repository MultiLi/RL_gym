Plan to learn RL by doing some interesting stuff, like playing game with gym


## CartPole
1. Simple policy gradient method, using a hand-written naive 3-layer neural network

## Frozen Lake

Try to implement some naive methods to this easy problem.

1. Q-learning with table
2. Q-learning with 'weights'
